                    <strong><em>Pogona</em></strong> is a genus of reptiles containing eight lizard species (though some sources say nine or ten) 
                    which are often known by the common name bearded dragons. The name "bearded dragon" refers to the 
                    "beard" of the dragon, the underside of the throat, which can turn black for a number of reasons, 
                    most often as a result of stress. They are a semi-arboreal species, spending significant amounts 
                    of time on branches, in bushes, and near human habitation. <em>Pogona</em> species bask on rocks and exposed 
                    branches in the mornings and afternoons. They are found throughout much of Australia in a wide range of 
                    habitats such as deserts, shrublands and Eucalyptus woodlands.
                    </p><p>
                    Several species of this genus, especially the central bearded dragon, are often kept as pets. They can 
                    also be exhibited in zoos due to their hardy nature and easy care in comparison to other exotic reptiles.
