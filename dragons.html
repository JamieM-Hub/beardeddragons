                    <strong><em>Pogona</em></strong> is a genus of reptiles containing eight lizard species (though some sources say nine or ten) 
                    which are often known by the common name <strong>bearded dragons</strong>. The name "bearded dragon" refers to the 
                    "beard" of the dragon, the underside of the throat, which can turn black for a number of reasons, 
                    most often as a result of stress. 
                    </p><p>
                    They are a semi-arboreal species, spending significant amounts 
                    of time on branches, in bushes, and near human habitation. <em>Pogona</em> species bask on rocks and exposed 
                    branches in the mornings and afternoons. 
                    </p><p>
                    They are found throughout much of <strong>Australia</strong> in a wide range of 
                    habitats such as deserts, shrublands and Eucalyptus woodlands.

                    <h3>A modern dinosaur</h3>
                    <img class="info-pic right" src="assets/images/info-page/dragon-shop.jpg" alt="Dragon with a shopping trolley"/>
                    <p>
                    The genus <em>Pogona</em> is in the subfamily <em>Amphibolurinae</em> of the lizard family <em>Agamidae</em>. Characteristics include broad, 
                    triangular heads and flattened bodies with spiny scales arranged in rows and clusters. These are found on the throat, 
                    which can be expanded when threatened, and at the back of the head. These scales are used to scare off predators, 
                    yet they are not very sharp. 
                    </p><p>
                    Bearded dragons display a <strong> hand-waving gesture</strong> to show submission (most often when 
                    acknowledging another bearded dragon's territory), and a <strong>head-bobbing display</strong> to show dominance between dragons. 
                    Some have the ability to slightly change colour during rivalry challenges between males, in response to ambient 
                    temperature changes such as turning black to absorb heat, and other stimuli. Bearded dragons also produce a <strong>mild venom</strong> originating from primitive venom glands. 
                    Although generally harmless towards humans, it is effective towards smaller-sized animals.
                    </p><p>
                    Males grow up to 60 cm (24 in) long, and females up to 51 cm (20 in).

                <article>
                    <h3>The Dragon's Den</h3>
                    <img class="info-pic left" src="assets/images/info-page/dragon-den.jpg" alt="Dragon in it's habitat"/>
                    <p>
                    Bearded dragons originate from deserts in Australia, with the various species occupying slightly 
                    overlapping areas of the landmass. They live in the arid and subtropical woodlands, scrublands, 
                    savannas, shore areas, and into the great interior deserts. Their range extends throughout the 
                    interior of the eastern states to the eastern half of South Australia and southeastern Northern 
                    Territory. They are considered to be <strong>semi-arboreal</strong> and will quite readily climb and bask at height. 
                    This is also linked to dominance behavior and competition for territory/basking areas. They can be 
                    found on fallen/broken trees, rocky outcrops and bushes when basking.
                    </p><p>
                    Bearded dragons go through a type of hibernation called <strong>brumation</strong>. Brumation is like hibernation 
                    where reptiles go months without eating but they sporadically drink water. Reptiles go dormant 
                    in the hottest temperatures, but it differs from brumation during cooler temperatures. When 
                    temperatures are extreme, there is a very small range between temperatures that the reptile's bodies 
                    can stay active and where their body cannot tolerate the extreme heat and they die. Bearded dragons 
                    go through brumation when the temperature goes below 60–70 °F during the night and 75–80 °F during the day 
                    for eight to ten hours. When the climate is too hot they will often <strong>burrow underground</strong>. They will 
                    also form more permanent burrows or covered hiding places to use as protection from the climate changes at 
                    night and predation.

            <div class="info-box">   <!-- SEXY TIME -->
                <article>
                    <h3>Sexy Time</h3>
                    <img class="info-pic right" src="assets/images/info-page/dragon-sexy.jpg" alt="Dragon looking very handsome inded">
                    <p>
                    When brumation comes to an end the male bearded dragon goes out to find a mate. A courtship ritual 
                    occurs where the male starts bobbing his head, waving his arms, and stomping his feet in front of the 
                    female. The male chases the female and will bite the back of her neck and hold on while he gets in 
                    position to copulate.
                    </p><p>
                    During the breeding period, female bearded dragons can store sperm in the oviductal crypts. This 
                    allows the female bearded dragon to lay a clutch of 11–30 eggs twice from one mating.
                    </p><p>
                    When breeding bearded dragons, the <strong>incubation temperature can change the sex of the baby</strong> within the egg 
                    regardless of its sex chromosomes. If the eggs are incubated at a higher temperature (34 °C/93.2 °F and higher), 
                    the hatchlings will be female and when the eggs are incubated at a lower temperature (30 °C/86.0 °F and lower) 
                    they will be male.
